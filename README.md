# Secure IoT Gateway with Embedded Linux and 802.11 Security

Build a secure IoT gateway running embedded Linux on an STM32 that connects to AWS IoT Core and manages multiple IoT devices.

## Components

1. STM32 + Linux Module (e.g., Raspberry Pi CM)
2. AWS IoT Core
3. Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)
4. STM32CubeIDE

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configure the Linux Environment

Set up a lightweight Linux distribution on the Raspberry Pi CM.
Install necessary packages for MQTT communication (e.g., Mosquitto).

### 2. Develop STM32 Firmware for Device Management

Use STM32CubeMX to interface with multiple sensors/devices connected via SPI/I2C.
Implement real-time data aggregation and transmission routines.

### 3. Implement Gateway Functionality

Write scripts on the Linux module to handle incoming data from the STM32 and relay it to AWS IoT Core.
Configure the Linux device as a secure access point that manages device connections.

### 4. Integrate 802.11 Security

Use WPA3 for secure Wi-Fi communication between the gateway and connected devices.
Implement encryption routines on the Linux module to protect data transmission.

### 5. Test and Monitor

Test the gateway by connecting multiple devices and monitoring the data flow in AWS IoT Core.
Use network analysis tools to ensure secure communication and troubleshoot any bottlenecks.
